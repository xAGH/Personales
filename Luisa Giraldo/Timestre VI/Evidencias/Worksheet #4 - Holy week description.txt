In my holy week i did a few things. 
For example, I went to dance with my brother who came from Medellin.
The last wednesday, I went to Santa Rita's nature reserve with very especial friends.
The next day I went with my brother and cousins from town to town.
On saturday, I attended to my nephew baptism as godfather.
